    </center>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The chemical periodic table is a structured arrangement of chemical elements, each represented by a unique <b><u><i>chemical symbol</i></u></b>, with the elements organized based on their <del>name</del>,<b><ins><mark>atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties</mark></ins></i></b>. The periodic table encompasses a vast array of elements, ranging from the lightest, hydrogen (H), to the heaviest, such as uranium (U) and beyond. Elements are organized into <b><i><u><mark>rows known as periods and columns known as groups</mark></u></i></b>, facilitating a systematic understanding of their properties.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The chemical symbols used in the periodic table serve as concise representations of each element. For example, the symbol 'O' represents oxygen <strong><mark><sub>15.9994</sub>O<sup>8</sup></mark></strong>, a crucial element for life, while <strong><mark><sub>55.84</sub>Fe<sup>26</sup></mark></strong> denotes iron, an essential component in various industrial applications. Additionally, chemical formulas provide a way to represent compounds composed of multiple elements. Water, a fundamental compound, is denoted by the formula <mark><b><u><strong>Hâ‚‚O</strong></u></b></mark>, illustrating the combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Within the periodic table,<b> elements in the same group often share similar chemical properties and form analogous compounds</b>. For instance, the <strong><mark>alkali metals in Group 1, including sodium (Na) and potassium (K),</mark></strong>  exhibit comparable reactivity patterns. On the other hand, elements in the <mark><strong><ins>halogen group, such as chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F)</ins></strong></mark>, are known for their <b><mark>tendency to form salts</mark></b>.</p>
